## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

This will clone the repository into a folder so you can use it locally.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sneakzttv/ITO5032-Assignment-Repo.git
cd ITO5032-Assignment-Repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

This will update all of the dependencies in the local repository.

```powershell
npm install
```

If this cannot be run due to system permissions bypass it with the command below.<br>
This command allows PowerShell to run scripts and commands only for the current session.<br>
It's safe and commonly used when npm/node scripts are blocked.<br>

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### 3️⃣ Run the server

Next you can initialize the server by entering the command below.<br>
Leave this running in the background whilst looking around.<br>
It can be closed by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.<br>

```powershell
npm run dev
```

To run the backend (optional to test mail client)

```powershell
node server.js
```

### 4️⃣ Connect to the local host web server in the browser

Once the server is running, visit the app at:<br>
