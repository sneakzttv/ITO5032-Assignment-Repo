## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

This will clone the repository into a folder so you can use it locally.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sneakzttv/ITO5032-Assignment-Repo.git
cd ITO5032-Assignment-Repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

This will update all of the dependencies in the local repository.

```powershell
npm install
```

If this cannot be run due to system permissions bypass it with the command below.
This command allows PowerShell to run scripts and commands only for the current session.
It's safe and commonly used when npm/node scripts are blocked.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### 3️⃣ Run the server

Next you can initialize the server by entering the command below.
Leave this running in the background whilst looking around.
It can be closed by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 4️⃣ Connect to the local host web server in the browser

Once the server is running, visit the app at:
👉 [Open App In Browser](http://localhost:5173/)
